# MC-Sans-Mod
⭐This Minecraft mod allows players to use the abilities of Sans from popular indie game, Undertale!

These abilities include every major attack from each wave in the Sans fight from Undertale, which is:

1. The ability to instantly dodge using the dodge item in the inventory.
2. The ability to spawn small and/or large spikes of bones around yourself to damage other players, using the single-bone or multiple-bones item in your inventory.
3. The ability to spawn and maintain a barrier of bones around yourself with a small gap in the barrier to mimic Sans's attack pattern in Undertale. The barrier is initiated as soon as the item is held and will disappear when the player switches items.
4. The ability to spawn and use a 3D gaster blaster to attack other player with, using the gaster blaster item in the inventory.
5. The ability to play boss music for yourself by right clicking on the battle hype item. The boss music can be changed in the zip file.
